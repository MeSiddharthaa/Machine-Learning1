What is a parameter?\n","\n","  -A parameter is an internal variable in a machine learning model that is learned from the training data. For example, in linear regression, the slope and intercept (weights and bias) are parameters.\n","\n","\n","2. What is correlation?\n","\n"," -Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related. It ranges from -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive).\n","\n","3. What does negative correlation mean?\n","\n"," -Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. For example, as the number of hours spent watching TV increases, test scores might decrease.\n","\n","4. Define Machine Learning.
